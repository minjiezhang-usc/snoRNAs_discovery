# Optimized denatured RiboMeth-seq (dRMS) for small RNAs

* Despite recent advancements, Nm site quantification remains challenging. The commonly used RMS hydrolyze RNA at high pH, where 2â€™-O-methylation protects the phosphodiester bond, which is detected by sequencing. However, stable RNA structures and dense modifications, especially for tRNAs, cause strong biases in the fragmentation and reverse transcription. Here, we developed a denatured RMS (dRMS) method by combining alkaline pH, high temperature and DMSO, which increased the efficiency and uniformity of RNA fragmentation.
